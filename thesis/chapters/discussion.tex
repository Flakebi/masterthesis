\subsection{Related Work}
\label{sub:relatedwork}
A part of this work is to profile shaders. There are many GPU profiling tools~\cite{UnityGPUProfiler, UnrealGPUProfiling, MSGPUUsage, PGI2014}.
Most of them show the needed computation time down to single draw calls or overall GPU performance statistics like occupancy\footnote{The amount of simultaneously executed threads on a \gls{cu}, hiding memory latency},used memory bandwidth and compute power~\cite{NvidiaNsight, NvidiaShaderPerf, AMDShaderAnalyzer}.
There are only few, which show detailed information about the inside of shaders. E.g GPUOcelot can trace single instructions in shaders when emulating CUDA applications on the GPU~\cite{GPUOcelot, Lakshminarayana2010}. Pyramid is an emulator and shader analyzer for various architectures, including AMD GCN~\cite{Pyramid}.
While emulation can provide accurate information, we cannot run our application at the same speed as on the GPU as the CPU has much less computational power.
Arm has something~\cite{Barton2013}.
In the high-performance computing space, they used Lynx~\cite{lynx} to instrument CUDA applications and automatically measure performance statistics~\cite{Farooqui2014}.

Benchmarks: Cuda SDK, Parboil, Rodinia, SHOC, Tensor (cite) but not Vulkan so we cannot use it. VComputeBench claims to be a general, publicly available benchmark for GPGPU~\cite{Mammeri2018}. However, we were unable to find these benchmarks online and the author did not respond to our questions.
