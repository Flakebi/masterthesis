\section*{Abstract}
GPUs are getting used for more and more diverse purposes: Games, High Performance Computing, even offloading computations in spreadsheets or databases.

Something GPU optimization \dots compiler has to guess hot branches \dots on CPUs common to get data with profiling \dots many tools for GPU profiling on the kernel/shader level \dots get used memory bandwidth, etc.

There is however a lot less tooling available to get instruction level data. E.g. how often a branch is executed.

Plan: Get that data, feed it back into the compiler to get accurate data optimizations. Tl;dr get PGO on GPUs.

This work focuses on profiling GPU kernels to generate the data which will later be needed for the optimizations.

Actual results.
